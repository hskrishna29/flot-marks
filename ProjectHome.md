Flot Marks is plugin for Flot Javascript plotting library. It produces **marks** pointing to specific x coordinates. It may be used to visualise **events**, **moments in time**, state transitions, interesting points on graps, etc.

The focus, as in Flot plugin is **simple** usage.

A little sample, called 'Washing the Tank' (see svn/trunk/example too):
